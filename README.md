I'm currently learning Python to understand the syntax, build simple/complex programs, and practice problem-solving.
This project is a collection of exercises, scripts, and experiments as I explore Python.

Goal:
To get comfortable with Python syntax, understand how Python thinks, and prepare for building real projects in the future.

Stay tuned for more scripts and progress!
